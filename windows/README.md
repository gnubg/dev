If you want to install this gnubg.exe executable in Windows: assuming you have installed the official gnubg version:

- (just in case: you can copy your gnubg preferences (the files in C:\Users\YourUsername\.gnubg) to some temporary folder)

- go to your gnubg folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\gnubg) and rename your gnubg.exe (or copy it to the same temporary folder)

- put there the downloaded gnubg.exe instead (and approve the Windows requests)
